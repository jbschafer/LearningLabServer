<div class="level2">
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> As was noted above in the Purpose section, it is a significant goal that students learn that while they can test how blocks work and what they do by clicking directly on them. However, it is important that students learn that while this is acceptable for testing, all code intended to be run in programs should begin with a hat block (in this activity, the green flag hat block)</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Other than that, it is expected that this activity is so self-explanatory that there won&#039;t be any significant challenges or misconceptions.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Encourage an environment of “fearlessness” We want a dojo where kids are willing to try things </div>
</li>
</ul>
