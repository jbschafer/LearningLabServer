<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> This will be a project students may be tempted to pound out in just a few minutes and “submit for credit.” Try to encourage exploration and creativity.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> The difference between sprites and costumes is often a source of confusion for Scratchers. The metaphor of actors wearing multiple costumes can help clarify the difference.</div>
</li>

<div class="level2">
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Can students distinguish between sprites and costumes?</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Some Scratchers are particularly art focused and will want to develop animation projects and prefer to spend their time drawing and designing sprites/costumes, etc. Try to engage students in both the aesthetic but also the technical aspects of this project</div>
</li>
</ul>
