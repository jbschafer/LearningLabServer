<p>
Now that you have learned a little bit about how stories and animations can be built using timing, broadcast messages, and the stage, let&#039;s work on some projects that have you create a story. For this activity you will  remix an existing project based on a scene from Harry Potter (Don&#039;t worry if you don&#039;t know the Harry Potter series. It won&#039;t really matter). You will have some freedom to go just about any direction you want to go, but you will work within an existing project.

</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Make sure that this character (or characters)  have at least four lines of dialog that blend into the storyline of the original program. Doing this will require that you also update the dialog of at least one of the current characters in your story. You may add this character in to one of the existing scenes or add an entirely new scene into the story (containing at least one of the original characters).  Either way, this new character should be a “sensible” addition to the overall story.</div>
