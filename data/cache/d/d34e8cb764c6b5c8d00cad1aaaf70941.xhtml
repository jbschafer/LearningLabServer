What can you create using only 12 Scratch blocks? While Scratch can do a lot of things, some languages are fairly small. Yet even small language will let you do a lot of cool things. In this activity you will learn how to think creatively when you only have a small language. 
By the time you will create a program that uses only 12 Scratch blocks - although you can use each as many times as you like. See how creative you can be with only that limited set of actions.
