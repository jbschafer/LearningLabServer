======Mastery Activity 1b : Music Video======
**Ninja Instructions** | [[lev1:Act_MusicVideo_m|Mentor Notes]]

=====Introduction=====
How can you combine animation with music to create your own Scratch-inspired music video?
This activity is longer than some of the previous ones we have done because we want you to experiment with sprites, costumes, backdrops, looks, sounds - lots of things!  You will create a program inspired by theatre, song, dance, music, drawing, illustration, photography, and animation to create a personalized music video.
To get some ideas you can check out:

  * Our dojo's studio:
          * [[http://scratch.mit.edu/studios/906422|http://scratch.mit.edu/studios/906422]]
  * A similar studio from the Scratch community:
          * [[http://scratch.mit.edu/studios/475517|http://scratch.mit.edu/studios/475517/]]


=====Duration =====
30-60 minutes

=====Instructions=====

  - Start by adding some sound to your project. This can be sounds that you find in scratch, ones that you make yourself, or ones that you import from other sources.\\ {{..:soundOptions.PNG}}
  - Create and animate one or more sprites.\\ {{..:spriteOptions.PNG}}
  - Make them interact together:  
    * Use costumes to bring your animations to life!
    * Make on sprite dance in time to your music.
    * Make another sprite interactive by adding scripts that have the sprite respond to clicks, key presses, and more.
    * Add instructions on the project page to explain h ow people can interact with your program.
  - Use a wide variety of blocks. Some suggestions:\\ {{..:musicVideoBlockOptions.PNG}}\\ \\ {{..:playSoundBlocks.PNG}}


=====Things to think about when you are done=====

  * What was one challenge that you overcame? How did you overcome it?
  * What is something you still want to figure out?
  * How did you give credit for ideas, music, or code that you borrowed to use in your project?
