[[lev1:Act_Initials_s|Ninja Instructions]] |  **Mentor Notes**

=====Purpose=====
The goals of this activity include:

  * exploring coordinate based (absolute) movement in Scratch
  * creating an image using pen-based, logo-like movement



=====Things to watch for=====

  * This activity is somewhat mathematical and requires an understanding of general coordinate systems. 
  * The Scratch stage has x values from -240 to +240 and y values from -180 to +180. These values can NOT be changed.


=====What to look for when reviewing their work=====

  * Did they, in fact, use the coordinate system (while the coordinates are somewhat hard to use, doing this with relative movement is even more complex).
  * Do their coordinates make sense?
          * Are they using the screen well.
          * Are vertical/horizontal lines used when appropriate (we don't want to force them to "color in the lines", but we might encourage them to make shapes that are "clean"
  * If their actual letters have "curves" in them have they made an attempt to make a curve? (Not a requirement, but we should encourage stronger students to do so).
