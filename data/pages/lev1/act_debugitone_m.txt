======Activity : Debug It #1======
[[lev1:Act_DebugItOne_s|Ninja Instructions]] |  **Mentor Notes**

=====Purpose=====
The goals of this activity include:

  * investigate the problem and find a solution to five debugging challenges
  * explore a range of concepts (including sequence) through the practices of testing and debugging
  * develop a list of strategies for debugging projects



=====Things to watch for=====

  * None of this is THAT hard. As such, student may finish the activity without much thinking. It helps to engage the students in a discussion about what was wrong with the programs. Putting it into words in a discussion is often more meaningful than the actual activity.


=====What to look for when reviewing their work=====

  * Were students able to solve all five bugs? If not, how might we clarify the concepts expressed in the unsolved programs?
  * What different testing and debugging strategies did the student employ?
