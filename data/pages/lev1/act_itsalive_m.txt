======Activity : It's Alive======
[[lev1:Act_ItsAlive_s|Ninja Instructions]] |  **Mentor Notes**

=====Purpose=====
The goals of this activity include:

  * becoming more familiar with the computational concepts of sequence and loops by experimenting with Control blocks
  * becoming able to explain the difference between sprites and costumes
  * practice experimenting and iterating through developing an animation project



=====Things to watch for=====

  * This will be a project students may be tempted to pound out in just a few minutes and "submit for credit." Try to encourage exploration and creativity.
  * The difference between sprites and costumes is often a source of confusion for Scratchers. The metaphor of actors wearing multiple costumes can help clarify the difference.
  * Students can animate themselves using a camera or webcam.


=====What to look for when reviewing their work=====

  * Can students distinguish between sprites and costumes?
  * Some Scratchers are particularly art focused and will want to develop animation projects and prefer to spend their time drawing and designing sprites/costumes, etc. Try to engage students in both the aesthetic but also the technical aspects of this project
