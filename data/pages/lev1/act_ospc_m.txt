======Activity : Orange Square, Purple Circle======
[[lev1:Act_OSPC_s|Ninja Instructions]] |  **Mentor Notes**

=====Purpose=====
The goals of this activity include:

  * allowing students to express their creativity by completing an arts-themed challenge
  * gain more fluency with Looks blocks and the paint editor



=====Things to watch for=====

  * This will be a project students may be tempted to pound out in just a few minutes and "submit for credit." Try to encourage exploration and creativity.
  * If students have questions, remind them that they can open the Tips Window to learn more about specific blocks or different parts of the Scratch editor.
  * Scratch supports both bitmap and vector graphics. This is both a good thing and a confusing thing as different styles support different features. If a student is struggling with a graphic, work with them to explore bitmap vs. vector graphics and see if one makes more sense than the other.


=====What to look for when reviewing their work=====

  * Do projects include an orange square and a purple circle?
  * Ask students to explain some of the things they tried but didn't use in their final project.
