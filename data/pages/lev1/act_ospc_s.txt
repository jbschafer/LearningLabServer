  - Add different Looks and Motion blocks to each to bring your sprites to life when the green flag is pressed. Compare the same code for both sprites and see how they are the same or different. (You can copy code from one sprite to another by dragging the code from one sprite and dropping it on the sprite icon of another sprite).\\ {{..:ospcStarter.PNG}}
  - Repeat with other shapes (remember, you should have both an orange square and a purple circle in your finished project).
  - You may want to play with stamping a copy of your sprite using the stamp block from the pen menu. You use the clear block to erase these changes later.<Br>\\ {{..:stampSample.PNG}}
