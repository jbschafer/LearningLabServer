======Activity : Build Your Own Scrolling Game ======
**Ninja Instructions** | [[lev4:act_scrolling_m|Mentor Notes]]

=====Introduction=====
In this activity you will create a basic side scrolling game.


=====Duration =====
15-30 minutes

=====Instructions=====
  - Open up a new program area in Scratch or begin by remixing our [[http://http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/51871028/#editor|Scrolling Starter]] program.
  - If you are creating this program completely on your own:
         * Add a sprite for an object that will move through your world like a helicopter or flappy bird.\\ {{..:scrollHeliImg.png}}
         * Add a sprite for the obstacles that you will be avoiding.\\ {{..:scrollBarImg.png}}\\ \\ You may want to make several different costumes for this object with the "opening" at different places so that you can add some challenge to your game.
         * Design your basic backdrop.\\  {{..:scrollBackImg.png}}
         * Put them all together so you have a simple pong game showing.\\ {{..:scrollFullImg.png}}
  - If you are using our sample starter code, take a look at what we have for these features.
  - 

Great.  Now you have a basic scrolling game.  Try some of these modifications.


  * Make a variable to keep score.
  * How do you add difficulty to the game by increasing speed of the obstacles or the rate at which the helicopter drops?  (Hint, you can watch the score or use a timer)
  * Can you add in the concept of multiple lives?
  * How can you add levels by changing the backdrops or the types of obstacles.


The following blocks make great blocks to play around with as part of this game:
