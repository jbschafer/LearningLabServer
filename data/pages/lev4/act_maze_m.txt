[[lev4:act_maze_s|Ninja Instructions]] |  **Mentor Notes**

=====Purpose=====
The goals of this activity include:

  * develop a greater fluency with computational concepts (conditionals, operators, data) and practices (experimenting and iterating, testing and debugging, reusing and remixing, abstracting and modularizing) by working on a self-directed maze game



=====Things to watch for=====




=====What to look for when reviewing their work=====

This game starts with a particular pattern for all games but encourages students to pursue various options.
   * Did they go beyond the base game to personalize it in some manner?
   * Does the finished game include conditionals, operators, and data?
