======Activity : Dream Game Brainstorm ======
**Ninja Instructions** | [[lev4:act_brainstorm_m|Mentor Notes]]

=====Introduction=====
This activity doesn't actually involve programming.  Instead, it is just a reflection activity to get you to think about games (both online and offline).


=====Duration =====
15-30 minutes

=====Instructions=====
  - Generate a list of games that you enjoy playing.  Begin by writing down as many as you can think of.
  - Go back over the list that you just made and identify your favorites - maybe your top 5 or so.
  - Look at your two lists.  Think about the following questions:
         * What do the games on the lists have in common?
         * What features of their design make them fun?
         * What features of their design make them *a game*?
  - Now take some time to imagine your dream game.  Write down:
         * a list of design elements for that game.
         * What will you need to use if you wanted to program that game?
         * What will you need to know about programming before you could program that game?


=====Things to think about when you are done=====

  * The key to this activity is identifying the design elements that make something a game and, hopefully, a FUN game.
