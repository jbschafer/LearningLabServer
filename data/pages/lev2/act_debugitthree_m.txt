======Activity : Debug It #3======
[[lev2:Act_DebugItThree_s|Ninja Instructions]] |  **Mentor Notes**

=====Purpose=====
The goals of this activity include:

  * investigate the problem and find a solution to five debugging challenges
  * explore a range of concepts (including events and parallelism) through the practices of testing and debugging
  * develop a list of strategies for debugging projects



=====Things to watch for=====

  * Being able to read others' code is a valuable skill and is critical for being able to engage in the practices of reusing and remixing.
  * Students can explain their revisions by right-clicking on Scratch blocks to insert code comments.


=====What to look for when reviewing their work=====

  * Were students able to solve all five bugs? If not, how might we clarify the concepts expressed in the unsolved programs?
  * What different testing and debugging strategies did the student employ?
