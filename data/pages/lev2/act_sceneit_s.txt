======Mastery Activity 2b : Scene It======
**Ninja Instructions** | Mentor Notes

=====Introduction=====
The last mastery activity asked you to focus on a nursery rhyme. In this activity you can follow the exact same set of guidelines, but you can animate a scene from your favorite TV show or movie. Or if you prefer, a scene from your favorite book. It's all about the power of using Scratch to allow you to be creative!
To get some ideas you can check out:

  * Our dojo's studio:

=====Duration =====
60-90 minutes

=====Instructions=====
Create a brand new story (not a remix this time) that:


  * Uses at least three different sprites where at least one of those sprites is someting you found on the Internet (not a pre-loaded image from Scratch)
  * Use blocks from a minimu of five of the six sub-menus:
      * {{..:motionSubMenu.PNG}}
      * {{..:looksSubMenu.PNG}}
      * {{..:soundSubMenu.PNG}}
      * {{..:penSubMenu.PNG}}
      * {{..:eventsSubMenu.PNG}}
      * {{..:controlSubMenu.PNG}}
  * Sequence several "actions" to "show" a scene from a book, TV show, movie, etc. when the green flag is pressed.
  * We strongly encourage you to use at least three of the following:
      * Recording your own sounds
      * The use of multiple costumes/backdrops
      * Incorporate something unique to you, your school, etc. (why not use a picture of you in your story?)
      * Use broadcast messages to synchronize your story


=====Things to think about when you are done=====

  * What are you most proud of in this program? Why?
  * What did you get stuck on? How did you get unstuck?
  * What might you want to add to this next?
