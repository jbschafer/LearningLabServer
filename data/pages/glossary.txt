When	you	write	code	for	the	computer	to perform	after	that	an	action	occurs,	that	code,	the	event-handler,	will	run	every	time	the	action	is	performed	without having	to	put	the	commands	inside	of	a	loop.	Many	event-handlers	are	human-initiated.	For	example:	an	event handler	might	respond	when	the	user	clicks	the	mouse	by	making	the	bird	flap	its	wings.	&quot;When	the	mouse	is clicked&quot;	is	an	event-handler.
