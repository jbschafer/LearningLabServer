[[http://scratch.mit.edu/|http://scratch.mit.edu/]]

If you have a little bit of experience using Hour of Code or some other basic programming language/environment, we suggest that you really learn about programming by studying Scratch. Even if you have played with Scratch on your own or in school, we suggest that you work through the following materials to build a better foundation for programming.

==== Level 0 Activities - Getting Started with Scratch ====
