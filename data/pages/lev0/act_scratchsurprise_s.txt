======Activity : Scratch Surprise======
**Ninja Instructions** | [[lev0:Act_ScratchSurprise_m|Mentor Notes]]

=====Introduction=====
This activity is intended to be one of the first activities you complete when you are new to Scratch. It is meant as a fun way for you explore a little bit about working with Scratch by dragging out and connecting the programming blocks. You will have a lot of freedom to explore the things YOU want to explore.  Don't worry if you don't understand everything that you do, but do your best to try and figure it out. 
By the time you are done you will have created a program that causes the cat to do something "surprising" when the green flag is pressed.

=====Duration =====
15-30 minutes

=====Instructions=====

  - Go to the Scratch website:  [[http://scratch.mit.edu|http://scratch.mit.edu]]
  - Sign into your account. If you do not yet have an account you should complete the [[lev0:Tut_ScratchIntro|Introduction to Scratch tutorial]].
  - Click on the "Create" tab located at the top left of the browser to start a new project.
  - If the tips section is visible on the right hand side of the screen you should hide it for now. You do this by clicking on the x in the upper left corner of the tips section\\ {{..:closeTips.PNG}}
  - Take some time to explore. Try clicking on different parts of the Scratch interface to see what happens.
  - Play with the different Scratch blocks from several of the different Scratch menus Suggestion, focus on the{{..:motionSubMenu.PNG}}, {{..:looksSubMenu.PNG}}, {{..:soundSubMenu.PNG}}, and {{..:penSubMenu.PNG}} menus for now. These are the ones you are likely to use as you first get started. But feel free to explore others if you like.
  - Don't forget to that the best way to run your programs is by using the "green flag block" {{..:greenflagBlock.PNG}} from the Control Menu ({{..:controlSubMenu.PNG}})  \\ {{..:firstDanceProgram.PNG}}
  - When you have a program that you like you should give it a name and save it. To change the name of a program type a name in the textbox located above the stage.\\ {{..:namingProgram.png}}\\ After that you can save it by selecting File -> Save now from the menus.\\ {{..:saveNow.png}}
