======Activity : Twelve Blocks======
**Ninja Instructions** | [[lev0:Act_TwelveBlocks_m|Mentor Notes]]

=====Introduction=====
What can you create using only 12 Scratch blocks? While Scratch can do a lot of things, some languages are fairly small. Yet even small language will let you do a lot of cool things. In this activity you will learn how to think creatively when you only have a small language. 
By the time you will create a program that uses only 12 Scratch blocks - although you can use each as many times as you like. See how creative you can be with only that limited set of actions.

=====Duration =====
15-30 minutes

=====Instructions=====

  - Make sure you know where to find each of the 12 blocks shown below (hint, the color of block tells you what menu contains it).\\ {{..:twelveBlocks.PNG}}
  - If you are unfamiliar with one of these 12 block you should explore how it works.
  - Create a project that uses each of these 12 blocks **at least** once.  
    * You can use a block MORE than once. 
    * You can modify any of the **parameters** (the numbers, words or selections in a drop down menu)
  - Mix and match the blocks in various ways until you get a project that you like.  



=====Things to think about when you are done=====

  *  What was difficult about being able to use only those 12 blocks?
  * What was easy about being able to use only those 12 blocks?
  * How did it make you think of things differently?
